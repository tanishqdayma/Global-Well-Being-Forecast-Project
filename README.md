# Global-Well-Being-Forecast-Project

## Overview

The Global Well-Being Forecast Project is a data-driven initiative focused on predicting happiness scores worldwide. Leveraging advanced statistical models, exploratory data analysis and regression analysis, this project delves into understanding the complex interplay of economic, social, and psychological factors influencing global well-being.

## Objectives

- Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover key factors shaping well-being.
- Implement regression model and enhance the efficiency by incorporating using feature engineering, regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
- Develop precise regression models (Linear, LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, Polynomial) to forecast happiness scores with a remarkable accuracy.
- 
## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Leveraged for data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and scripting.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Utilized for interactive and detailed data analysis.
